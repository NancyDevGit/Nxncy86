### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finding an intership where I can start demostrating my developing skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Android app projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help about how to start a career with the right foot.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love learning languages. Sometimes they're easy to learn than programming languages and sometimes they're more difficult.

Another thing I want to add is that I'll be updating daily this file, since I'm new to Markdown markup language.
