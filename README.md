<h2 style="text-align: center;">Hi everyone ✌️ I'm Nancy G.</h2>

- 😀 I’m currently working on finding an intership where I can start demonstrating my developing skills.
- 👩‍💻  I’m currently learning Kotlin.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Android app projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help about how to start a career with the right foot.
- 🙋‍♀️ Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love learning languages. Sometimes they're easier to learn than programming languages and sometimes they're more difficult.

Another thing I want to add is that I'll be updating repositoy daily, since I'm new to Markdown markup language.
